Friendly staff.Try the coconut mojitos (garnished with actual mini coconuts!) Or the Passion Fruit Margarita (yum!) New menu. Mainly Everything is Spanish style (rice and beans, tostones, maduros,etc). They have a larger dining area on the 2nd floor and an outdoor patio that's only accessible through the inside of the bar.",
